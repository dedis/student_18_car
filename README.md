Cothority

# Cothority

The collective authority (cothority) project provides a framework for
development, analysis, and deployment of decentralized, distributed
(cryptographic) protocols. A given set of servers running these protocols is
referred to as a _collective authority_ or _cothority_. Individual servers are
called _cothority servers_ or _conodes_. The code in this repository allows you
to access the services of a cothority and/or run your own conode. The cothority
project is developed and maintained by the [DEDIS](http://dedis.epfl.ch) lab at
[EPFL](https://epfl.ch).

This is an overview of this README:
- [Documentation](#documentation) with links to different parts of the cothority
  - [Topically ordered](#topically-ordered) explains the different functional
    pieces from the cothority from a research point of view
  - [Network ordered](#network-ordered) gives an overview from a networking point
    of view
  - [Links](doc/README.md) collects
  links to other repositories, papers and webpages that are important to the cothority.
- [1st steps](#first-steps) giving two example apps ready to use
- [Participating](#participating) on how to help us getting cothority even better
  - [Setting up your own conode](#setting-up-your-own-conode) describes why you
    might want to set up your own conode

Don't forget that the cothority is part of a [bigger
environment](https://github.com/dedis/doc/tree/master/README.md).

## Disclaimer

The software in this repository is highly experimental and under heavy
development. Do not use it for anything security-critical yet.

**All usage is at your own risk**!

## Versioning and Roadmap

We started to work on a 6-monthly cycle, synched up with the semesters at EPFL. From
March to August we keep changes on the master-branch non-API breaking. Master and the
current version https://gopkg.in/dedis/cothority.v2 are kept in sync. In September,
we allow API-breaking changes in master and only selectively update the stable branch.
End of February we freeze the current development in a stable branch and start again a
non-breaking period of 6 months.

The current master branch is stable till the end of August 2018. If you are
starting new work with this repository, use gopkg.in/dedis/cothority.v2 instead.
The source code for this stable branch is
[here](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/tree/v2).

During 2018, we hope to bring you the following new pieces:
- Cross platform mobile application to interact with the pop service
- ByzCoin implementation using key/value pair storage and protected by darcs

Other pieces we hope to achieve in 2018:
- Distributed internet archival functionality
- New status-website of the cothority
- Catena integration for skipchains

And some projects are private for the moment, but we hope to make them public
as soon as possible.

# Documentation

The goal of the cothority is to collect projects that
handle aspects of collective authorities to support scalable, self-organizing
communities. In this document we present the apps that are directly runnable
from the cothority, as well as links to the services and protocols used in
the cothority.

A cothority is a set of conodes that work together to offer collective
authority services. This is used to create distributed and decentralized
services where no single point of failure can put the whole system in jeopardy.
Conodes communicate with each other using protocols that are short-lived, specific
tasks with an outcome that can be read by services. Each conode has a set of
services that can be contacted through a well-defined API from the outside. The
communication through the API is done with a homebrewn protobuf over websockets
implementation.

## Topically ordered

When looking at the cothority modules from a topical point of view, we can break
it up as follows:

### Applications

Applications in cothority use different libraries and are the highest level
of abstraction in our framework.

Here you get [a list of all applications in the cothority](doc/Applications.md).

There is one very special application that is considered apart - it's the conode
itself, which holds all protocols and services and can be run as a service on
a server.

[What a Conode can do for you](conode/README.md)

### Building Blocks

Building blocks are grouped in terms of research units and don't have a special
representation in code. Also, the _General Crypto_ library is more of a
collection of different protocols.

Here you get [a list of all building blocks in the cothority](doc/BuildingBlocks.md).

## Network Ordered

If we look at the cothority from a purely networking point of view, we can
describe it as follows:

```ascii art
              +-----------------+                 
              |CLI, JavaScript, | Frontend        
              |Java             |                 
+-------------+-----------------+                 
| Conode,     | Services        | Client to Conode
| Simulations |-----------------+                 
|             | Protocols       | Conode to Conode
+-------------+-----------------+                 
```

### Command Line Interfaces

Command line interfaces (CLI) are used to communicate with one or more conodes.
All CLIs need to have one or more conodes installed.
For the two CLIs in [first steps](#first-steps), you can use the running conodes
at EPFL/DEDIS. If you want to test the other CLIs, you might need to set up
a small network (often 3 nodes is enough) of conodes on your local computer
to test it.

Here you get [a list of all available CLIs in the cothority](doc/CLIs.md).

### Services

Every app communicates with one or more services to interact with one or more
conodes. This is a list of available services that can be contacted on a running
conode. Some of the services are open to all, while others might require authentication
through a PIN or a public key. Most of the apps and services have the same name,
but some are not available as an app or have more than one app using it.

Here you get [a list of all available services in the cothority](doc/Services.md).

### Protocols

Protocols are used to communicate between conodes and execute cryptographic
exchanges. This can be to form a collective signature, create a consensus on a
new state, or simply to propagate a new block from a skipchain. Some protocols
are useful for different services, while others are very service-specific.
Most of the protocols have a paper that is describing how the protocol should
perform and that compares it to other protocols.

Here you get [a list of all available protocols in the cothority](doc/Protocols.md).

### Simulations

Cothority grew up as a research instrument, so one of its advantages is to have
a framework to create simulations and running them locally or on remote servers.
Some of the protocols presented here do have the simulation code. Check it out
here: [Cothority Simulations](doc/Simulation.md).

# First steps

If you're just curious how things work, you can check the status of our test
network or create a collective signature using our running nodes:

## Status

To get the status of the conodes in the cothority, first install the status binary:

```go
go get github.com/dedis/cothority/status
export DEDIS_GROUP=$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/dedis/cothority/dedis-cothority.toml
```

Now you can run it by giving the definition of the dedis-cothority on the command line:

```go
status --group $DEDIS_GROUP
```

## Collective Signing

Another service available is fault-tolerant collective signing, or ftCoSi. It
requests a collective signature from a set of conodes. The signature is created
on a given input data. For installation, type:

```go
go get github.com/dedis/cothority/ftcosi
export DEDIS_GROUP=$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/dedis/cothority/dedis-cothority.toml
```

Now you can create a file and have it signed by the cothority:

```go
date > /tmp/my_file
ftcosi sign --group $DEDIS_GROUP /tmp/my_file | tee sig.json
```

And later somebody can verify the signature is correct by running the following command:

```go
ftcosi verify --group $DEDIS_GROUP --signature sig.json /tmp/my_file
```

If everything is correct, it should print

```
[+] OK: Signature is valid.
```

# Participating in the cothority

There are different ways to participate in the cothority project. A first step
is to simply test the different CLI applications in this repository and tell us
what were your difficulties or what you would like to use them for.

A next step is to set up your own conode and participate in the

## Setting up your own conode

A conode is a server program that includes all protocols and services. It can
be run on a public facing server, but for testing purposes it's also possible
to set up a network on a machine and only let it be accessed locally.

- [conode](conode/README.md) is the cothority
server, a special app that includes all services and protocols.
- [How to run a conode](conode/Operating.md)
gives an overview of the environment where a conode can be run
- [DEDIS-cothority](doc/Join.md)
explains how to join the DEDIS-cothority

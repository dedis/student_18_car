Operating a Conode

# Operating a Conode

Here you find some general information about how to run a conode. For command
line examples, please refer to:
- [Command Line](CLI.md) for running a conode in a virtual machine or on a
server
- [Docker](Docker.md) how to run a conode with the pre-compiled docker image

## Reverse proxy

Conode should only be run as a non-root user.

The current recommended way to add HTTPS to the websocket port is to use a web
server like Apache or nginx in reverse proxy mode to forward connections from
port 443 to port 6880, the default websocket port.

If you want the websocket port to be on a port under 1024 (i.e. 443 for
HTTPS), you can use setcap to give the conode binary the necessary privs: `sudo
setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip $(go env GOPATH)/bin/conode`

## Backups

On Linux, the following files need to be backed up:
1. `$HOME/.config/conode/private.toml`
2. `$HOME/.local/share/conode/$PUBLIC_KEY.db`

The DB file is a [BoltDB](https://github.com/coreos/bbolt) file, and more
information about considerations while backing them up is in [Database
backup](https://github.com/dedis/onet/tree/master/Database-backup-and-recovery.md).

## Recovery from a crash

If you have a backup of the private.toml file and a recent backup of the .db
file, you can put them onto a new server, and start the conode. The IP address
in the private.toml file must match the IP address on the server.

## Roster IPs should be movable

In order to facilitate IP address switches, it is recommended that the public IP
address for the leader of critical skipchains should be a virtual address. For
example, if you have two servers:
* 10.0.0.2 conode-live, also with secondary address 10.0.0.1
* 10.0.0.3 conode-standby

You can keep both servers running, and use scp to move the DB file from
conode-live to conode-standby. Both servers should have the same private.toml
file, which includes the line `Address = "tcp://10.0.0.1:6879"`

In the event that conode-live is down and unrecoverable, you can add 10.0.0.1 as
a secondary address to conode-standby and start the conode on it. From this
moment on, you must be sure that conode-live does not boot, or if it does, that
it *does not* have the secondary address on it anymore. You could do so by not
adding the secondary address to boot-time configs, and only move it manually.

The address 10.0.0.1 will be in the Roster of any skipchains, and nodes which
are following that skipchain will still be able to contact the leader, even if
it is now running on a different underlying server.

Note: The address part of a server identity has name resolution applied to it.
Thus it would be possible to set the roster of a skipchain to include a server
identity like "tcp://conode-master.example.com:6979" and then change the
definition of conode-master.example.com in DNS in order to change the IP address
of the master.

## Reverting the cothority

If you control all of the nodes in a cothority, it is in theory possible to
rewrite history by saving all the DB files at a certain point in time, and then
later restoring them all at the same time. To be certain that all the DB files
are consistent with themselves, and with each other, all of the conodes should
be down at the time the backup is taken.

If you do not control more than 2/3 of the conodes, it is not possible to rewind
the state of the cothority. This is by design, and is the fundamental feature of
a group of mutually untrusted servers who are working together to provide a
cothority.

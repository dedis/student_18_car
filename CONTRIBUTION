Making Contributions

Cothority is an Open Source program with many contributors (listed in the AUTHORS
files), so we actively seek contributions (help on the Cothority users list,
documentation, source code, ideas, â€¦).  All contributions help us make a
better product.

All contributions without an explicit copyright statement or a CLAI/CLAC (see below)
are assumed to be covered under a AGPL 2-Clause license as described in the
file LICENSE.

Developers who have contributed significant changes to the Cothority code must sign
a Contributor License Agreement (CLAI), eventually also a CLAC if they work for
a corporation. Together they guarantee them the right to use the code they have
developed, and also ensures that EPFL/DEDIS (and thus the Cothority project) has the
rights to the code.
By signing the CLAI/CLAC, your contributions are eligible to be integrated into the
Cothority source code.
Having the CLAI/CLAC signed is essential for the Cothority project to maintain a
clean copyright and guarantees that Cothority and your source code will always remain
Free Software (Open Source).
Providing that your contribution is accepted by the Cothority project, your signed
CLAI/CLAC also permits EPFL/DEDIS to submit your contribution for use in other
EPFL/DEDIS-projects.

The Contributor License Agreements are in the CLAI and CLAC-file.

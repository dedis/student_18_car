# dedis-java-library

These are a couple of libraries that are to be used with different java-
implementations. They will probably migrate sooner or later to
github.com/dedis/cothority.

## Crypto

Getting the warm cozy feeling of having the power to add, subtract,
scalar multiply and do other fancy things with points and scalars.

## ServerIdentity

The node-definition for a node in a cothority. It contains the IP-address
and a description.

## Roster

A list of ServerIdentities make up a roster that can be used as a temporary
cothority.

## Darc

Distributed Access Rights Control - an experimental idea how to get user management
decentralized.

## DecryptKey

Does the onchain-secrets algorithm to retrieve the symmetric from the cothority.

## UUIDType5

I couldn't find a uuid-type5 library, so I copied this one from the web.

ssh-keys, webpages, letsencrypt certificates and any key/value pair.
- [cosi](../cosi/CLI.md) request and verify collective signatures (DEPRECATED)
- [ftcosi](../ftcosi/CLI.md) request and verify collective signatures
- [evoting](../evoting/CLI.md) run an election on a decentralized system using
skipchains to store the votes
- [ftcosi](../ftcosi/CLI.md) request and verify collective signatures using
part of the bzycoinx protocol
- [pop](../pop/CLI.md) create and participate in Proof-of-Personhood parties
where each participant gets a cryptographic token that identifies him
anonymously as a unique person
- [scmgr](../scmgr/README.md) skipchain Manager to inspect a running skipchain
- [status](../status/CLI.md) query the status of a cothority server

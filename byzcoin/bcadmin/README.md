# bcadmin - the CLI to configure ByzCoin ledgers

## Create a new ByzCoin, saving the config

```
$ bcadmin create -roster roster.toml
```

The `roster.toml` file is a list of servers what form the cothority that will
maintain the ledger. After running `run_conode.sh local 3` for example, the file
`public.toml` will have the 3 conodes in it. For a larger production deployment,
you will construct the `roster.toml` file by collecting the `public.toml` files
from each of the servers.

The ByzCoin config info (the skipchain ID and the roster for the cothority)
are stored in the local config directory (~/.config/bcadmin or ~/Library/Application
Support/bcadmin) and the filename is printed on stdout. The ByzCoin config file
will be used by other tools to know where to send their transactions. It has no
seret information in it.

The secret key is saved in a file named after the public key. It must not be
shared!

To see the config you just made, use `bcadmin show -bc $file`.

## Granting access to contracts

The user who wants to use ByzCoin generates a private key and shares the
public key with you, the ByzCoin admin. You grant access to a given contract
for instructions signed by the given secret key like this:

```
$ bcadmin add -bc $file spawn:theContractName -identity ed25519:dd6419b01b49e3ffd18696c93884dc244b4688d95f55d6c2a4639f2b0ce40710
```

Different contracts will require different permissions. Check
their docs. Usually they will need at least "spawn:$contractName" and
"invoke:$contractName".

Using the ByzCoin config file you give them and their private key to sign
transactions, they will now be able to use their application to send
transactions.

## Environmnet variables

You can set the environment variable BC to the config file for the ByzCoin
you are currently working with. (Client apps should follow this same standard.)

160202:

      channels more easily. If you simply include onet.SimulationBFTree in
      your protocol-struct, a do-nothing Dispatch is defined per default.

160202:
    - added a 'SingleHost'-flag for the `runlevel/*toml`-files. When set to
      true, only one host per server is initialised:
       + faster running, uses less resources
       - not real conditions with regard to propagation of new trees.
       - doesn't run on more than 4095 nodes yet

# Docker

You need a server with a public IP address and at least 1GB of RAM and docker
installed. First you need to setup the conode, use the following command to
setup conode in your `~/conode_data`-directory:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 6879-6880:6879-6880 --name conode -v ~/conode_data:/conode_data dedis/conode:latest ./conode setup
```

This will create a `conode_data`-directory and ask you for the configuration details:
- PORT: the indicated port and port+1 will be used for communication. If you
change this port, also update the ports in the docker-command.
- IP-address: if it cannot detect your IP-address, it will ask for it. This
usually means that something is wrong. Perhaps you didn't allow your firewall
to accept incoming connections
- Description: any description you want to share with the world
- Folder: press <enter> for the default folder - it will be redirected to `conode_data`

There are two important files in there:
- `private.toml` - do not give this away - it's your private key!
- `public.toml` - the description of your conode that you can send to dedis@epfl.ch
and ask us to include it

If you change the port-number, you will have to adjust the numbers
used in the `docker run`-command.

## Starting Conode

Once a conode is setup, you can start it like that:

```
docker run --rm -p 6879-6880:6879-6880 --name conode -v ~/conode_data:/conode_data dedis/conode:latest
```

### Using Crontab

An easy way to start a conode upon system-startup is crontab. Add the following
line to your crontab (`crontab -e`) and your conode will start with the next
system-startup:

```
@reboot docker run --rm -p 6879-6880:6879-6880 --name conode -v ~/conode_data:/conode_data dedis/conode:latest
```

### Using systemd

If you have systemd, you can simply copy the `conode.service`-file and add it to
your systemd-startup. Of course you should do this as a non-root user:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dedis/cothority/conode/conode.service
systemctl --user enable conode.service
systemctl --user start conode
```

Unfortunately systemd doesn't allow a user to run a service at system startup,
and all user services get stopped once the user logs out!

## Setting up more than one node

You can start multiple nodes on the same server by using one user per node and
set up the nodes as described above. Be sure to change the port-numbers and
remember that two ports are used.

## Joining the dedis-cothority

The only existing cothority for the moment is available at
http://status.dedis.ch. You can send us an email at dedis@epfl.ch to be added to
this list.

## Compiling your own docker file

To create your own docker-image and use it, you can create it like this:

```bash
go get github.com/dedis/cothority
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/dedis/cothority/conode
make docker
```

If you use `make docker_run` the first time, a directory called `conode_data` will be
created and you will be asked for a port - use 6879 or adapt the Makefile - and a
description of you node. Your public and private key for the conode will be stored
in `conode_data`. If you run `make docker_run` again, the stored configuration will
be used.

To stop the docker, simply run `make docker_stop` or kill the docker-container. All
configuration is stored in `conode_data`

# Apps

For most of the apps you need at least 3 running nodes. Once you have them up
and running, you will need a `roster.toml` that includes all the
`public.toml`-files from your conodes:

```
cat ../*/conode_data/public.toml > roster.toml
```

You will find more details about the available apps on
[Applications](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/tree/master/doc/Applications.md).

# Development version

For the latest and greatest version of the conode, you can replace `conode:latest`
with `conode:dev` and you should get a stable, but changing conode. This means, that
to use all the functionalities you need to update the apps and follow the latest
`conode:dev` container regularly.

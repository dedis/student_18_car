# Blockchain Based Approach for Preserving Car Maintenance History

Fighting frauds in the automotive industry is an ongoing challenge. Concerned by this problem are not only the owners and potential buyers of second-hand vehicles, but also entities like insurance companies, garages, car dealers, police etc. We present a solution for establishing trust between these parties, by keeping records of repairs and maintenance vehicle inspections in a ByzCoin Blockchain.
 Our implementation builds on top the Cothority Template ([Template](https://github.com/dedis/cothority_template))

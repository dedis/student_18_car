Fault Tolerant Collective Signing

# Fault Tolerant Collective Signing

This package provides functionality to request and verify collective signatures
as well as run a standalone server for handling collective signing requests.
It is a fault tolerant version of CoSi, implemented in
[cosi](../cosi/README.md) package.

## Research Paper

It is the basis for the ByzCoinX protocol. For further background and technical
details, please refer to the
[research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/406.pdf).

## Description

The purpose of this work is to implement a robust and scalable consensus
algorithm using ftCoSi protocol and handling some exceptions. The ftCoSi tree
is a three level tree to make a compromise between the two-level tree, making
the root-node vulnerable to DoS, and a more than three level tree, slowing the
algorithm because of the RTT between the root node and the leaves.

The tree is composed of a leader (root-node), and some groups of equal size,
each having a sub-leader (second level nodes) and members (leaves). The group
composition are defined by the leader.

Ideally, we want to handle non-responding nodes, no matter where they are
in the tree. If a leaf is failing, then it is ignored in the ftCoSi commitment.
If a sub-leader is non-responding, then the leader (root node) recreates the
group by selecting another sub-leader from the group members. And finally, if
the leader is failing, the protocol restarts using another leader. At the
moment, however, we only handle leaf and sub-leader failure.

More complex adversaries (modifying messages, non-responding at challenge time,
etc.) are not yet handled.
The purpose of the project is to test scalability and robustness of this
service on a testbed and to have a well-documented reusable code for it.

## Implementation
The protocol has four messages: 
- Announcement which is sent from the root down the tree and announce the
proposal.
- Commitment which is sent back up to the root, containing an aggregated
commitment from all nodes.  
- Challenge which is sent from the root down the tree and contains the
aggregated challenge.  
- Response which is sent back up to the root, containing the final aggregated
signature, then used by the root to sign the proposal.

The protocol uses five files: 
- `struct.go` defines the messages sent around and the protocol constants.  
- `protocol.go` defines the root node behavior.
- `subprotocol.go` defines non-root nodes behavior.
- `gen_tree.go` contains the function that generates trees.
- `helper_functions.go` defines some functions that are used by both the root
and the other nodes.

Under-the-hood, there are two protocols. A main protocol which only runs on
the root node and a sub-protocol that runs on all nodes (including the
root). The tree structure of the sub-protocol is illustrated below.

```
       root
         |
         |
     sub-leader
      /       \
     /         \
  leaf_1 ... leaf_n
```

Namely, if there are m sub-leaders, the root will run m sub-protocols. The
sub- protocols do bulk of the work (collective signatures) and communicates
the result to the main protocol via channels.

- [ftCoSi CLI](CLI.md) is a command line interface for interacting with ftCoSi
- [ftCoSi protocol](protocol) the protocol used for collective signing
- [ftCoSi service](service) the service with the outward looking API
